            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <p>
                The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, <br>
                each
                of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively).
                <br>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally,
                vertically,
                or diagonally adjacent. <br> <br>At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
                <br>
                1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by under population. <br>
                2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. <br>
                3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. <br>
                4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
                <br> <br>
                These rules, which compare the behaviour of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the
                following: <br>
                1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives. <br>
                2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell. <br>
                3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
